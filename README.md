## Impetus

This learning module introduces the Markdown format as a tool for scientific writing and presentation, highlighting its role in facilitating the integration of data, analysis code, and findings communication using R and RStudio.

## Module Learning Objectives:

**MLO 1: Markdown Document Creation**

>  Create professional, publication-ready documents in RStudio using Markdown and Quarto as a platform for clear, reproducible scientific communication.

- *Bloom's Level:* Create
- *Notes:* This objective frames Markdown/Quarto not as a technical gimmick, but as the medium through which scientific communication happens in the course. The résumé exercise functions as practice, while future modules deepen the communication into data-driven contexts.

## Supporting Content
